    1. In the Registration page, backend API error message displaying 
    2. In the AddStory component, during story creation
        when the function to make ApiCall is name onSubmit, it didnt work. 
        But when it was name handleStoryAdd, it worked. why? 



Notes ----------->

    1. Work on DRF serializer : 
        Story List serializer   
            Show Author's name, and story's images
    
    
    2. If a state variable is supposed to store an array-> then 
        the initial value of the state variable must be an empty array. not null.
