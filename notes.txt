Errors Faced --------> 
    1. In the Registration page, backend API error message displaying 
    
    2. In the AddStory component, during story creation
        when the function to make ApiCall is name onSubmit, it didnt work. 
        But when it was name handleStoryAdd, it worked. why? 
    
    3. In the StoryDetails component, why do i need optional chaining 
        for accessing nested serializer attribute. 

        Even though i didnt need it for Story List (Newsfeed) page. 

        3.2 => 
        and in StoryDetails component,  direct useffect was effective, but , 
        separate async await function , and then calling that function 
        inside useffect was not effective, why?
    
    4. Pagination Problem -----> 
        - 29 stories. hence 3 pages. 
        - but when clicked on 3rd button twice, the totapages becomes 4. 
        Why!!!




Notes ----------->

    1. Work on DRF serializer : 
        Story List serializer   
            Show Author's name, and story's images
    
    
    2. If a state variable is supposed to store an array-> then 
        the initial value of the state variable must be an empty array. not null.
